"Midnight" theme for FluxBB
https://github.com/yrosen/FluxBB-Midnight-Theme

Dark theme, developed for and tested on FluxBB 1.4.
To use, just copy the files to your FBB 'styles' folder, and select 'midnight' in the admin panel.

This theme uses some browser-specific CSS & CSS3 - may not work in older browsers or Internet Explorer. Try it out!

To do eventually:
 - Buttons
 - More cross-compatibility...
 - Clean up & re-factor the CSS file
 - Background images for code & quote boxes
 - Some physical layout changes

If you use it, please let me know! Feedback, questions, etc - you can contact me at yudi42@gmail.com.
