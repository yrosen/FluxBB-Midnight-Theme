Dark theme, developed for and tested on FluxBB 1.4.
To use, just copy the files to your FBB 'styles' folder, and select 'midnight' in the admin panel.


My TODO list:
 - Buttons
 - Code boxes, h* elements, blockquotes, not sure what else
 - Admin panel & profile pages
 - Maybe some cool text effect for header
 - Test in things other than Firefox

If you use it, please let me know! Feedback, questions, etc - you can contact me at yudi42@gmail.com.
