Dark theme, developed for and tested on FluxBB 1.4.
To use, just copy the files to your FBB 'styles' folder, and select 'midnight' in the admin panel.

This theme isn't done yet! I've got a few things left to fix:

1) Navigation styles - Some random padding or something in there, could use fixing.

2) Form elements - especially buttons. I still need to make them pretty.

3) Admin panel - I haven't touched this (yet).

4) Icons - Low priority, but icons are always fun to play with.

5) Header - It looks boring. And I *could* use images but I'm trying to think of something cool.

Additionally, it hasn't been tested yet in any browsers other than Firefox 4.

If you use it, let me know! Feedback, questions, etc - you can contact me at yudi42@gmail.com.
